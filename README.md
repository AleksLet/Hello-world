# Hello-world
My first repository. Who knows, what it will lead to?
My name is Alex and im on my way to JS Junior (omg, i have no idea whether it ever exist "JS junior" or not. Im newbie here.) 
What is more - it's my longest message i wrote in English for the last several years. Honestly, i'm proud of myself and it doesn't matter whether it was wrote right or with mistakes.
